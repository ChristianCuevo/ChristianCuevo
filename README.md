# 👋 Hey there! I'm Christian

## 🚀 About Me
I’m a **Marketing Automation & AI Systems Builder** with a background in **Mathematics and Data Science**, focused on designing **production-grade AI workflows** that drive real business outcomes.

I specialize in working at the intersection of **marketing, data, and engineering** — building systems that automate outbound campaigns, standardize AI usage, improve data quality, and scale lead generation without adding headcount.

I don’t just use AI — I **operationalize it**.

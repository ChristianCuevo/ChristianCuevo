👋 Hey there! I’m Christian
🚀 About Me

I’m a Marketing Automation & AI Systems Builder with a background in Mathematics and Data Science, focused on designing production-grade AI workflows that drive real business outcomes.

I specialize in sitting at the intersection of marketing, data, and engineering — building systems that automate outbound campaigns, standardize AI usage, improve data quality, and scale lead generation without adding headcount. I’m hands-on, experimental, and obsessed with turning messy processes into reliable, repeatable systems.

I don’t just use AI — I operationalize it.
